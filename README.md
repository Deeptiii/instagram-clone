# Project Details

Created a full-stack web application for users to upload pictures with captions. The users can also follow and unfollow other users, like and comment on their pictures as well. Used ReactJs and Materialize CSS for the front-end design of the application.

Used Node.js on server-side with NoSQL(MongoDB) database. Created the REST API end-points on the back-end to provide the application functionality using ExpressJS. Also, implemented the user registration and login using JWT.
